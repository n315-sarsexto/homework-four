The main purpose of this homework is to interact with some of the Sweet Alert functions. Given that I love red pandas, I figured that I could toss them in as a bit of a theme for the unofficial Red Panda club. All around, I enjoyed getting to mess around with some new alerts, as well as some interaction with the user!
